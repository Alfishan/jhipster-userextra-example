# jhipster-userextra-example

This is a complete minimal example of a JHipster application using my tip on how to store extra information for a user with a UserExtra entity.

You can find the tip I'm talking about here : https://jhipster.github.io/tips/022_tip_registering_user_with_additional_information.html

Here's what's been added to the base JHipster project :
- The registration page now asks for the user's phone number which will be stored in the UserExtra entity
- The user management page (in the administration panel) now shows the users' phone number
